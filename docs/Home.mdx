# Create Big Bang

A lightweight Javascript build setup tool with minimal opinions.

Create Big Bang has 2 goals:

1. **To empower you to create publishable npm packages with as little up-front effort as possible.** Projects using create-big-bang to get started can ship to various targets.
2. **To allow the natural evolution of build tools after the initial setup.** create-big-bang performs an initial templating process to get you up & running fast for building npm package with minimal opinions. After the initial templating process, tasks like maintaining dev dependencies, build tool configurations, etc. can evolve naturally based on the needs of the project. This puts the project maintainers in close control of their entire environment instead of relying on a build tool to maintain these things. (Note: We are fans of build tools like CRA when building applications, but prefer maintaining control of such things when building projects that will be published as npm modules.)
